**Chess Playing Robot(a.k.a ‘The Turk’)**_

_

**Abstract**_

Chess playing robot is a 

semi automated robot.It consists of a mechanical arm to pick and drop chess pieces.The arm is controlled using microcontroller Arduino 

uno and various motors.The robot uses 

camera to detect opponent’s move and play according to the chess engine code that is fed through 

arduino.

**Acknowledgement**_

We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our mentors Sushant Samuel Sir(EE 3rd year),Animesh Sir (GPT 4th year)and Anmol 

Popli Sir (EE 3

rd Year) as well as our guide and senior mentor Prashant Shekhar Sir(EE 4

th year & secretary, Models and Robotics Section) and Sparsh Gupta Sir (EE 4

th Year) who gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project which helped us in doing a lot of research and we came to know about so many new things.

**THANKS AGAIN TO ALL WHO HELPED US.**

**Motivation**_

Garry Kasparov VS Deep Blue

**Deep Blue** was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM.Deep Blue won its first game against a world champion on February 10, 1996, when it defeated Garry Kasparov in game one of a six-game match.This game is a living example what a machine is capable of.To explore it ourselves we built the chess playing robot.

_

**Hardware**_

The mechanical design of the bot includes mounting of:

1. Stepper Motor (12 volt)(1): 

1. Servo Motor(6 	volt)(x3): 

1. Arduino Uno(x1): 

1. Adapter(12V,5A)(x2) 

1. L298 Motor Drivers(1): 

1. Gears(x3): 

1. Combination of LM317 and 	potentiometer for voltage regulation: 

8)Castor Wheels(3):

_

**Work**_

The bot consists of Stepper motor mounted at the base which provides angular movement.The mechanical arm picks and drops pieces with the help of gripper.The arm movement is controlled by using 3 servo motors.The motors are synced by using microcontroller Arduino Uno.

Camera is mounted at 

top to detect opponent’s move 

and and following code is used to control the robot.We have developed two version of chess 

engine ,one is in Java and other is in C++.

_

**Application**_

1. Our 

bot can be used for AI 	research. 
2. It can be used to 

develop 	advance chess engine.
